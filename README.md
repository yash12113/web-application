1. Profile Display: Create a webpage that presents a collection of profiles,
each comprising essential information such as the person's name,
photograph, and a brief description.
2. Interactive Mapping: Incorporate an interactive map component that can
dynamically display addresses based on user interactions. This map will
allow users to see the geographical location associated with each profile.
3. Summary Integration: Implement a "Summary" button adjacent to each
profile. Clicking this button should trigger the display of the map
component with a marker indicating the precise address of the selected
profile.
4. (Good to have ) Map Services Integration: Utilise external map services like
Google Maps or Mapbox to integrate the mapping functionality into the
application. This entails setting up markers and correctly rendering
addresses on the map.
5. User-Friendly Experience: Ensure that the application offers a smooth and
intuitive user experience, enabling users to easily navigate profiles and
access mapped addresses without confusion.
6. Profile Data Management : Allow administrators to add, edit, or delete
profiles.
7. This will require an admin panel or dashboard to manage the profile data
efficiently.
8. Search and Filter Functionality : Provide users with the ability to search and
filter profiles based on different criteria, such as name, location, or other
attributes. This enhances the usability of the application.
9. Responsive Design : Ensure that the application is responsive and
mobile-friendly so that users can access it from various devices, including
smartphones and tablets.

10. Error Handling Implement robust error handling and validation
mechanisms to handle issues gracefully, such as invalid addresses or
failed map service requests.
11. Loading Indicators : Include loading indicators of progress bars to give
users feedback when the application is fetching data or rendering the map.
12. Profile Details: Create a separate profile details view that provides more
in-depth information about each profile when a user clicks on a profile
card. This can include additional details like contact information, interests,

etc.
